# Simon memory game

## About

Simon is a game that tests your short-term memory.The original device created a series of tones and lights and required a user to repeat the sequence. This HTML version of the game does not use any tones, just lights for simpicity sake.

Goal of this excercise is to practice TDD (Test Driven Development).

## Test framework
Test framework used is Jest https://jestjs.io/

### Install and setup
To create the package.json, first initialize with:

`npm init`

Only add "jest" as a test command and you can leave everythin else as default 

To install Jest run:

`npm install jest --save-dev`

Note: since Jest 28 "jest-environment-jsdom" needs to be installed separatley, so run:

`npm install jest-environment-jsdom --save-dev`

Test file is located in scripts/tests
